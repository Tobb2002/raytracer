# Structure for Report

## Introduction
- What is this report about?
  - What is raytracing?
  - Use cases
- state of the art (known literature)
- goal -> calculate light transport

## Concepts
- how to represent images
- Calculation of light
  - what is a ray?
  - intersecting objects.
  - calculate light at intersections (phong)
  - different materials and light effects

## Implementation (chalanges and solutions)
- loading a scene
- intersecting objects 
  - triangles 
  - planes
- implementing a light source (pointlight + area)
- implement a camera -> generating rays
  - follow ray paths (also reflecting materials)
- modeling different materials
- transformations (modelview transform)
  - rotating and moving objects
  - implement a camera view transform
- antialiasing
- (tonemapping and gamma correction)

## Analysis
- Use cases for current Implementation
- efficiency -> further possibilties


## Conclusion
- at the moment included in Analysis
